Assessment
What will learners make to show you that they've mastered each learning objective?
Students will develop an understanding of the formalistic aspects of design and visual communication. They will demonstrate cross-platform (web, mobile, broadcast, print) storytelling skills. They will become familiar with graphic design and/or game theory and be able to apply this theory to real-world projects. They will develop an understanding of information design and usability as it applies to interactive media projects. They will utilize coding and software tools to analyze and present data in a professional manner that could be translated into web-based or app-based media. They will write at a level suitable for a public audience in an area related to interactive media (e.g., technical writing, game writing, writing for social media, presentation of a CV) 

What is the criteria for success for each objective?
Interacting with the teachers and also being active throughout the session and also expressing there own thoughts on every topic will automatically indicate that they took the knowledge very well and they had this very good grasping power and also the session going there. The interaction plays a very important key in all the sessions because that is when we will get to know that a person is understanding all the concepts that are been taught. By doing relevant projects using the learned technology, exhibits in project expos and academic level.

Activities
What content, exercises and support will you provide to help learners work towards the assessment? Here are some tips:
Create discrete steps - build multiple smaller things that add up to something bigger
Authentic - only design activities that teach skills which learners will actually use in the assessment
Agency & Appeal: make sure that activities matter to learners, and they want to be able to do it

Feedback
What type of feedback do you plan to give to learners?
One of the best feedback that we can give to all the learners is analyzing the performance throughout the session and also recognizing them for there best performance. Encouraging the young learners is always a good idea because it encourages them a lot to learn more and more in the future and also it will help them to grow as an individual in any sessions in the future. Recognizing all the best performers and also not letting down the remaining performers conducting some activities in between which will make sure that every one are been interactive and also there are involved in the session and the best performance we will be given all the small swags and also gits as recognition and also the rest of them we will be giving very good feedback that they have done very well and all these resources we can provide them so that they can improve in that particular field.

How will you provide opportunities to learners to provide feedback?
Even we will be conducting feedback sessions very often in every break with going interacting with all the students so that we will all the inputs how they actually felt about the session and also any improvements that are needed to be done. also after every session that is suggestable to just send a google form them to fill it out how they felt about the session all the important questions that we wanted to ask them all those this is a very good way to get the feedback and also keep a track of it so that we will be wearing all the necessities required with in the next sessions.
