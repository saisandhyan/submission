Talk planning
Tell us a little bit about your talk:

What is the topic?
My topic is on Android development.

Why do you care about it?
I care about android because in our country the users are mostly using Android electronics like phones, televisions, etc. I want to get awareness among everyone that what is android and how it is been used and what mainly it is. I am an android nanodegree developer I want to let everyone know about this. I want to explain to everyone, how to build an android app and the uses of it along with the database.

What story might you be able to tell?
In this talk I want to present the android platform, what is Android. A simple Hello Android Application has been studied to show you how easier it is to develop applications for this platform. All the students who have studied Java should study Andriod Programming as well because it is easy to understand and you don't even need any physical device to test our applications. But, of course, if you are working on Bluetooth then obviously you cannot test it without any real phone. Operating Systems have developed a lot in the last 15 years. Starting from black and white phones to recent smartphones or mini computers, mobile OS has come far away. Especially for smartphones, Mobile OS has greatly evolved from Palm OS in 1996 to Windows pocket PC in 2000 then to Blackberry OS and Android. One of the most widely used mobile OS these days is Android. Android comprises not only the operating system but also middleware and key applications. Android Inc was founded in Palo Alto of California, the U.S. by Andy Rubin, Rich miner, Nick sears and Chris White in 2003. Later Android Inc. was acquired by Google in 2005. I want to explain all the features of the android with a live example like the features and specifications of android are:
1.Application framework
2.Virtual machine
3.Integrated Browser
4.Optimized graphics
5.SQLite
6.Media Support
7.GSM Technology
8.Bluetooth, EDGE, 3G, Wi-fi
9.Camera, GPS, Compass, etc
The architecture consists of four sections: the Linux kernel (system) as underlying operating system interface, the libraries as an important part of the operating system; the Android framework providing all necessary classes and methods to write Android compatible applications; and, as top section, the actual Android applications

What is your goal? It might be to inform, persuade or entertain.
My goal to take this talk is to make everyone understand the android and the features that. I have two main goals:
1.Convey information.
2.Keep audience attention.
Firstly, It's important to know Java because the Android applications have Java coding in it. Secondly, XML is the second most important skill for Android app development since it enables you to work on the app layout and design. Firstly, I will give an introduction about Android and later I will explain to them about where and how to use that. So, now they might get clarity about what they are going to do and in between, there will be some competitions so if anyone is winners in that then they will get some swags as an appreciation. My main goal is to make everyone to get the knowledge on Android.

Who is the intended audience in terms of skills, interests and experience?
The intended audience for this talk is the students who are familiar with java. Because Building Android applications requires a deep knowledge of programming and design.  If you’re a web developer already, many of the concepts and technologies involved in Android development will be analogous to things you already know – although building apps for mobile devices often requires mastery of many more nuanced concepts. Java is the language that underpins all Android development. XML was created as a standard way to encode data for internet-based applications. It is a structured markup language, sharing many features in common with HTML – you may recognize the angled brackets, the <opening> and </closing> tag types, and the deep nesting of elements.SDK stands for Software Development Kit, which, though it may conjure up images of a briefcase full of spy tools, is actually just a fancy name for a set of pre-packaged code. The Android SDKs are modules of Java code that give developers access to device functions like the camera and accelerometer. One key component of the Android SDK is a library called Gradle.

Abstract
Imagine you're at a conference and your talk has been accepted. At the same time as your talk, there are two others. An abstract is your talk's elevator pitch - convince people why they should come to yours. Start with some context, a problem statement or claim, and continue into your solution and a description of what the talk will be like.
Your abstract should be between 150-200 words as 1-2 paragraphs.

Android is a software stack for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key applications.  Android is a software platform and operating system for mobile devices based on the Linux operating system and developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance. It allows developers to write managed code in a Java-like language that utilizes Google-developed Java libraries, but does not support programs developed in native code.
The unveiling of the Android platform on 5 November 2007 was announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of 34 hardware, software and telecom   companies devoted   to   advancing   open   standards   for   mobile devices.   When released in 2008, most of the Android platform will be made available under the Apache free-software and open-source license.
